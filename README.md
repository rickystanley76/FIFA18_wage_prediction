# FIFA18_wage_prediction
Using the dataset from Kaggle(the FIFA 18 players data) i would like to find out the best model by comparing three algorithms LinearRegression, Random Forest and XGboost.

# Includes
The repo includes ipython notebook,the dataset(which is cleaned and ready to be used for model building)

# Comparison result

Linear regression       11207.53(RMSE)    0.711(R2)
Random Forest           11416.64(RMSE)    0.700(R2)
XGboost                 10769.43(RMSE)    0.733(R2)

By seeing the above results we found xgboost is the best one over other algorithms we tried in this experiment.
